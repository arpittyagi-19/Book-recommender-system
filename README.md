# Book Recommender System
## Introduction to Recommender Systems
Recommender systems are algorithms designed to suggest items to users based on various factors such as past behaviors, preferences, and similarities. These systems are widely used in many domains, including e-commerce, social media, and content streaming platforms, to enhance user experience by providing personalized recommendations.

## Types of Recommender Systems
### Content-Based Filtering:

Recommends items that are similar to those the user has liked in the past based on item features. For instance, if a user likes action movies, the system will recommend other action movies.
### Hybrid Recommender Systems:

Combine multiple recommendation strategies to improve the accuracy and robustness of the recommendations. For example, combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering.
### Knowledge-Based Recommender Systems:

Use domain knowledge about how certain item features meet user preferences to recommend items. These systems are often used when users have specific requirements that cannot be met by collaborative or content-based filtering alone.


### Colaborative Filtering
#### Collaborative filtering is one of the most popular and effective methods for building recommender systems. It works on the principle of leveraging the preferences and behaviors of users to predict what other users might like.

##### User-Based Collaborative Filtering
In user-based collaborative filtering, the algorithm finds similarities between users based on their past interactions with items. It then recommends items that similar users have liked.

##### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
In item-based collaborative filtering, the algorithm finds similarities between items based on the users' interactions. It recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past.

### Project Description
Book Recommender System Using Collaborative Filtering
This project involves building a book recommender system using collaborative filtering. The system provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their reading history and preferences.

#### Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on the preferences of similar users.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books similar to those the user has liked.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes user ratings for various books. Each entry consists of a user ID, book ID, and rating.

### Requirements
##### Python 3.x
##### NumPy
##### Pandas
##### Scikit-Learn
